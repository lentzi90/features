# Kubeadm (kubeadm)

Kubeadm. Nothing more, nothing less.
You should not expect this to be able to `kubeadm init` a new custer without adding other dependencies and configuration.
But it can be useful for checking commands, docs and running specific phases.

## Example Usage

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/lentzi90/features/kubeadm:0": {}
}
```

## Options

| Options Id | Description | Type | Default Value |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| version | Select or enter kubeadm version to install. | string | v1.26.0 |
