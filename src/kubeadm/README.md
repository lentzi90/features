Kubeadm, nothing more, nothing less, just the binary.

## Example Usage

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/lentzi90/features/kubeadm:0": {}
}
```

## Options

| Options Id | Description | Type | Default Value |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| version | Select or enter kubeadm version to install. | string | v1.26.3 |

You should not expect this to be able to `kubeadm init` a cluster without adding additional tools and configuration.
